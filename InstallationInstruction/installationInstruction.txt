1. Find the sql text file within the installation Instruction folder, import the db via phpmyadmin, workbench or any other mysql GUI. 

2. In ubuntu terminal just copy the project folder under /var/www/html

3. Type the path /var/www/html/{projectname}

4. Run the command: php artisan config:cache

5. Run the command: php artisan serve

6. You will find the output on root of the project path. Ex. Autogenerated path http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Note: I have pushed the .env file into the git repository. In case of any issue kindly copy from there.
